# Shinylive: Running Shiny Apps Without a Server

**Shinylive** is a lightweight, browser-based version of Shiny that lets you run apps without a server. Unlike traditional Shiny apps, which require hosting on a platform like shinyapps.io or Posit Connect, Shinylive compiles your app into WebAssembly and runs it entirely in the user’s browser.

This means there’s **no backend server**, no deployment cost, and no setup headaches. You can publish it for free on GitHub Pages or Quarto Pub and share a link.

## Key Differences

| Feature            | Traditional Shiny         | Shinylive                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Hosting            | Needs R server             | Runs in browser (serverless)     |
| Setup              | Moderate                   | Very simple                      |
| Package Support    | Full R packages            | Limited to browser-safe packages |
| Use Cases          | Dashboards, internal apps  | Demos, teaching, lightweight tools |

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- No server or hosting costs
- Easy deployment (works with static sites)
- Great for small apps, education, and demos

**Cons:**

- Limited package support
- No access to external data or files
- Not ideal for large or complex apps

## Final Thoughts

Shinylive is best for simple, shareable apps. Think quick prototypes, interactive lectures, or public demos. For more complex apps with real-time data or heavier processing, traditional Shiny will still be the better tool to use.
