# Vehicle Performance Dashboard

This interactive dashboard uses the built-in `mtcars` dataset to explore the relationship between weight, miles per gallon (MPG), and engine characteristics.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Create a scatter plot
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl), text = rownames(mtcars))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency vs. Vehicle Weight",
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per Gallon",
    color = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
```
