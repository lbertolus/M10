    "text": "What Is Shiny?\nShiny is an R package developed by Posit (formerly RStudio) that makes it simple to build interactive web applications. It’s a powerful tool for data analysts and scientists who want to share results in a more engaging, hands-on way.\nWhether you’re building a data exploration tool, a dashboard for KPIs, or a simulation model, Shiny helps you move from reporting data to engaging users with it."

    "section": "How a Shiny App Is Structured",
    "text": "How a Shiny App Is Structured\nShiny apps are built around three core components:\n\n1. UI (User Interface)\nThis is what your users see — the layout, buttons, sliders, plots, and tables. You design the interface using functions like fluidPage(), sidebarLayout(), and mainPanel().\n\n\n2. Server Function\nThis is where the logic happens. The server function takes the user’s input and tells the app what to do with it — like filtering a dataset or updating a graph.\n\n\n3. shinyApp()\nThis wraps everything together and launches the app in a browser."
